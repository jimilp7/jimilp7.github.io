This is a draft post I'm working on. It won't appear on my site until:
1. I'm ready to publish it
2. I move it to the `_posts` directory with a proper date in the filename
3. OR I run Jekyll with the `--drafts` flag to preview it

## Why Use Drafts?

Drafts are perfect for:
- Working on posts that aren't ready for the world
- Testing out ideas without publishing
- Keeping your work organized

## How to Preview?

To see this draft on your local site, run:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
```

The draft will appear with today's date!
